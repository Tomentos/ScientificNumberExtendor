# Scientific Number Generator

## Reason behind making this

I made this because I once made [a really big calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/evknab) and wanted to show off how big the number I calculated really is. Counting all 228 zeroes at the end of that number was a pain in the arse.

I do want to follow up on [that really big calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/evknab) by extending it even further. Since I don't want to waste another 10 minutes by writing all these zeroes out by hand I decided to waste a few hours of my life by making this program.

It's basically to mess around with and has no real actual or important purpose at all.


## What does it do

This program has two different types of inputs. *The decimal input* and *the multiplicator input*.

It works exactly like back in math. Except in math 3.14 * 10^64 is seen as a result because the actual full number with all it's zeores would be way too long to write out, obviously.

With this program you will be entering this *result* and it will output the full number with all it's zeroes.

In the case of **3.14 * 10^64** the output will be **31400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000**. And yes, I did use my program to generate the full number.


### Why?

I don't know.
